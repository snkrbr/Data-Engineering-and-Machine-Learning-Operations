The Group consists of Lina, Snorre and Mike.<br>


## Assignment 1 
For the assignment 1 we have decided to work with Steam Reviews with 11529 observation.<br>
Our goal was to make a classification model which predicts whether comment is positive or negative and vizualize it via Grad.io <br>
SQLite was used for proccesing our classification model and simulating a database. <br>


## Assignment 2 
### EDA
For assigment 2 we have chosen a small HR dataset with 10 columns and 14.999 observations <br>
The dataset has been put into a polars dataframe for further Data exploration <br><br>
### Visualization <br>
For visualization we've used matplotlib as it's easy to use, but also visually appealing. <br>
The 4 visualizations is: <br>
1. Violin plot for average monthly hours <br>
2. Violin plot for satisfaction level <br>
3. Bar chart for visualizing number of projects vs time spent at company <br>
4. Pie chart showing percentage of people working at each department. <br>
